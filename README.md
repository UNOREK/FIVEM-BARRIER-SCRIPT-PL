 Checkpoint Barrier System — FiveM Vanilla
A dynamic barrier system with teleportation, vehicle spawning, and checkpoint handling — built for training, testing, or event scenarios within the Vanilla. Minimal interface, maximum utility.

- Set up to 10 checkpoints using the C key.
- Instant teleportation to the checkpoint with a shinobi vehicle by pressing . (dot).
- Automatic teleport and respawn on vehicle when crossing the barrier.
- Visual lines and minimap blips marking the barrier.
- Live checkpoint counter with flashing warning indicator.
- Automatic cleanup of previously spawned vehicles (no clutter!).

 Installation
- Download or clone this resource into your resources/[local]/ folder.
- Ensure you have the shinobi vehicle available on the server.
